# **AdventureTracker**

Adventure Tracker Backend Repo: https://github.com/Skidragon/adventure-tracker-backend

With this site, a person can safely go adventuring with the knowledge that their friends and family will be able to monitor their progress.

When planning your adventure, you will set up waypoints along your route and check in when you get to each one. A person or people who you give access, can monitor your check ins, making sure everything is going well. In version 2.0, there will be a cell coverage map included so you can make better decisions as to where to set your waypoints.

There is a sample trip to show you how easy it is to use and of course, there will be a history of your past adventures, so you can relive the glory!
